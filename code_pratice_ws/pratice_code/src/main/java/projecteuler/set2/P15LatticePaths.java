	In an n by n grid, after completing any particular path, you're making a grand total of n moves to the
	right (R) and n moves down (D) (just in a jumbled order). Consider, though, that once you've chosen the
	order/positions of the n R's (for example), you automatically know that the D's must fill the remaining spaces.
	 This is why we choose n positions to be labeled as R's out of the total space of 2n possible positions
	  we have to choose from.
