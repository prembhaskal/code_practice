MSDN library - search for "window function"


File Aggregator -- puts the window information data into a file.

TODO
File Data Parser -- reads the data from the file. Use Read Lock, Write Lock etc, so that data read is proper.

TODO
On locked windows - window name and process id are both empty.. handle this while parsing.
for explorer.exe- the window name might be empty.

	com.sun.jna.platform.win32.Kernel32.INSTANCE
